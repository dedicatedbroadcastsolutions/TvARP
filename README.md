TvARP - Television Automated Recording and Playback
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is designed to provide Tv automation for recording, playback, local insertion,EAS insertion,
and playlist management.  The target application is to use input streams from ASI or IP sources in to a 
D2Mux 5020 multiplexer to create an ATSC TV Channel.  Initially the feature set is restricted to just EAS
relay and insertion in to the digital domain from a standard analog EAS system.  Other features will be 
added as possible.

To compile, open the .pro project file for the appropriate module with Qt Creator.  Make sure to set the
build directory to be the sample build directory, and set the working directory to the release subfolder.
These settings can be found in the projects tab under build and run respectively.
